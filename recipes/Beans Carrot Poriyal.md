## Ingredients

- 20 or so Beans
- Half a big, thick carrot
- 2 tsp Mustard Seeds
- 1 tsp Urad Dal
- Pinch of Hing
- Pinch of Haldi
- Salt to taste
- 2 tbsp Grated or Shredded Coconut (frozen is fine)

## Directions

- Cut the beans and carrot finely. 
- In a wide pan, keep it on mid-heat. Add the sesame oil.
- Mustard seeds. [[Mustard seeds should pop about 75%, before adding the next spice]].
- Add the carrots first and then the beans. Move it around so it absorbs the oil.
- Add all the spices and salt. Move it around so it's coated. You'll notice everything shrink as you add the salt – this is good.
- Put the lid on for at least 2 minutes, a maximum of 5 minutes. You don't want the carrot to caramelize. 
- Add the coconut, and let it melt (if frozen). 
- The coconut will wilt as it absorbs the water / oil / spice mixture currently in the pan – this is when it's done. 

## Notes

```ad-tip
Urad Dal is optional. [[Ruhi]] doesn't prefer it.
