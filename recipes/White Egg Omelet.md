## Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 1/2 medium red onion
- 1 green chili
- Salt / Pepper to taste

## Directions

- Dice onions and green chili. Separate the cilantro leaves from the stems. We'll only use the leaves 
- Add olive oil to a pan
- Add green chili and onions
- Once the onions sweat, it's done

Meanwhile...
- Break the eggs on the bowl, and keep pouring it from one shell half into the other to separate the yolk from the white
- Whisk until bubbly

And bring it all together
- Add the onion / chili mixture to the egg-white and mix to combine
- Pour mixture on the pan, and set the heat to 1.5 or 2 out of 6
- Add parmesan and cilantro leaves
- Put a lid on wait. When the egg smell comes, that means it's ready.

## Notes

- Cumin powder makes it a masala omelet
- Could add red chili powder and coriander powder to the onion mixture as well
