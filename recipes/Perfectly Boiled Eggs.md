## Ingredients

- 3 Eggs

## Directions

- Add about 0.5L of water to a pan, or enough so that all the eggs are submerged
- Boil the water first, and when it comes to a slow boil, add the eggs
- 7 minutes, no more and no less
- Cool down using ice, or cold water. Ice is always better, but more effort.
- It should be perfectly cooked on the white, and *ever-so-slightly* runny in the middle
