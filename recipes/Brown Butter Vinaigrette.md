## Ingredients

- 1 tsp finely diced shallot
- 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tsp red wine vinegar
- 4 tsp oilive oil
- salt 
- pepper

## Directions

- Finely dice the shallot. [[Macerate]] it for 15 minutes. 
- Add olive oil, salt, and pepper
- Stir or shake
- This makes about half a cup of dressing

## Notes

- The vinegar-y taste seems to sit in the bottom, so shaking was better
- I felt that the oil was too much when tasting the dressing raw, but Kale absorbs quite a lot of oil in general.
