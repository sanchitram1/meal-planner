## Ingredients

- 1 capsicum, sliced into quarters, then halfway, and across
- 4 carrots, sliced circular or into 1-inch length-wise
- 1/2 tsp hing
- 2 tbsp sambhar powder
- 1 tbsp salt
- 3/4 cup Toor Dal
- 1 sprig of curry leaves
- 4 tsp of mustard seeds
- 2 tsp of methi seeds
- Salt to taste
- Pinch of haldi
- 1/2 tsp of Haldi

## Directions

- Boil half the curry leaves, capsicum, and carrots with Sambhar Powder, Hing, Salt, until about 80% cooked
- Meanwhile, pressure cook Toor dal with a pinch of Haldi till its mashed (12 minutes in [[Instapot]]). Once you remove it, mash it nicely so you can't make out the individual dal pieces
- Add mashed dal to the stew, one scoop at a time, mixing each one before adding the next scoop
- Let it cook on sim for about 10 minutes. If the dal sinks to the bottom, keep stirring it. Worst case is allowing the dal to char at the bottom of the pot
- For tempering, use Gingelly oil **only**. Add mustard seeds first, and let it start spluttering. Then add methi seeds and curry leaves.
