## Ingredients

- 1 Potato, thinly sliced
- 1 Small Onion, or Half a Medium, thinly sliced
- Thin Poha is preferable – 2–3 cups should be fine. 
- Mustard Seeds
- Cumin (optional)
- Curry Leaves
- Turmeric
- Asafoetida
- Salt

## Directions

- Soak poha for at least 15 minutes before. Thicker poha might require longer…so it is important to know what you're buying.
- Oil & Mustard splutter
- Curry leaves and crackle
- Onion – do not let this caramelize. Just when it starts sweating add the potatoes. 
- Let the potatoes cook for about 3–5 minutes. Thinly sliced means that it will cook quickly
- Add all the spices here. 
- Add the soaked poha. Keep adding water so it completes cooking.

Meanwhile:
- Dry roast some peanuts. Raw would be better
- Add them to the top of the prepared poha
- Garnish with cilantro

## Notes

```ad-tip
You can make the entire packet dry, with the masala mixture, without soaking the Poha in water before. Then pack it up and heat it, like Maggie for whenever you want it. Could probably freeze it as well.
```

```ad-tip
You should add extra of all the spices, since Poha is incredibly bland by itself
