## Ingredients

- 1 Large Tomato, finely diced
- 1 Large Onion, finely diced
- 2–4 pods of garlic
- About an inch of Ginger – cut how you like it. I like long strips.
- 1 tsp of cumin
- 1 tbsp Sesame Oil
- 1–2 green chilies, depending on your spice level. You can either:
	- Cut into small circles (spicier)
	- Slit (spicy only if you bite into it)

## Directions

- Oil
- Cumin – start vibrating, but not blacken
- Green chili, Garlic, Ginger.
- When above becomes aromatic, add the onion
- Once the above is sweating, add the tomatoes
- Add some water and put a lid on for at least 5 minutes
- Now, add the spices:
	- Haldi
	- Salt – wait for it to reduce
	- Dhanya – no skimping
	- Red Chili Powder
- Let it become a bit pasty – according to your desired consistency.

## Notes

```ad-tip
For the tomato to become pasty, 5–6 on an electric stove or 3 on my fire, means about 7–10 minutes. Leaving it undisturbed is fine, but make sure it's not blackening. You can add water, and stir if you suspect it's charring.
