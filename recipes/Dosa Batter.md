## Ingredients

- **2 cups (0.47 l) Idli rice** (or any short-grain rice)
- **1 cup (0.24 l) Urad dal** (split black gram)
- **1/4 cup Chana dal** (optional, but recommended for flavor)
- **1 teaspoon Methi seeds** (fenugreek seeds)
- **1/4 cup Poha** (flattened rice)
- **Salt** (non-iodized or rock salt)
- **Water** (as needed)

## Directions

- Rinse the rice, urad dal, chana dal, and methi seeds thoroughly. Soak them in separate containers with enough water for about **4 to 6 hours**
- Soak poha in a small amount of water for about **30 minutes** before blending
- Drain the water from the dal and methi seeds. Add soaked poha to the blender jar with the dal. Pour in **¾ cup cold water** and blend until smooth and frothy
- Drain the water from the rice and add it to the blender. Pour in **½ cup water** and blend to a slightly coarse consistency
- Combine the rice and dal batters in a large bowl. Mix well to achieve a thick pouring consistency
- Add **½ teaspoon of non-iodized salt** to the batter and mix well
- Cover the bowl with a cloth or lid and let it ferment in a warm place for **8 to 18 hours**, depending on the temperature
- The batter should double or triple in volume, be frothy, and have tiny bubbles. To test, drop a spoonful into water; it should float if well-fermented
- Stir the fermented batter gently. If it's too thick, add a little water to achieve a spreadable consistency

## Notes

```ad-tip
If the batter is too thick, add a little water. If it's too thin, add some rice flour to thicken it
```

```ad-tip
In cold climates, use an oven with the light on or an Instant Pot on the yogurt setting for **8 to 14 hours**
