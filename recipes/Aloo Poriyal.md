## Ingredients

- 2 potatoes, cut however you like. I like half-circles.
- Pinch of turmeric
- 1 tsp of Sambhar powder
- Salt to taste
- 1 tbsp of mustard seeds
- 1/2 tbsp of urad dal
- pinch of Asafoetida
- 1 tbsp of ghee

## Directions

- Boil potatoes:
	- 15–20 minutes, until a fork goes through in boiling water
	- Pressure cooked for 12 minutes in the [[Instapot]]
- Ghee to a nice, non-stick pan
- Mustard seeds, and let it splutter
- Then Urad dal – be sure that they don't blacken. Just as they start turning color, add them potatoes
- Add haldi, sambhar powder, and salt. Ensure the potatoes are nicely coated
- Optional, but you can add a bit more ghee here
- Put a lid and let it sim over a low / low-medium flame. Every 3-ish minutes, you can mix everything, and investigate the charring. Good Aloo Poriyal has a lovely char to it

```ad-tip
Potatoes tend to be sticky, so you choice of pan is important!
