## Ingredients

- 1 cup of Rajma
- 1 tbsp of Ginger Garlic Paste, or the homemade [[Ginger Garlic Paste]]
- 1 tsp of cumin
- 2 medium onions, finely diced
- Salt to taste
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp red chili powder
- 1 tsp dhanya powder
- 1 tsp garam masala (optional)
- 2 medium tomatoes, purée 
- One julienne of ginger, and one sprig of coriander for garnishing
- 1 tbsp Ghee

## Directions

- Pressure cook the Rajma with Salt for about 9–12 minutes
- In a large pot, add cumin to the ghee, and let it start spluttering
- Add the ginger garlic paste and sauté till fragrant
- Add the onions, and sauté until they turn **brown**. 
- Add the spice powders and mix well
- Add the tomato, and sauté until the oil starts to separate
- Add the boiled Rajma and mix for 3–4 minutes
- Add reserved water – I liked more liquid-y Rajma, so I'd add excess here
- Garnish with ginger and coriander

## Notes

```ad-tip
You could use only ghee for this, or replace the ghee with oil
