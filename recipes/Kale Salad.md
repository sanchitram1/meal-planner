## Ingredients

- 1 bunch Kale, preferably Lacinato, Cavolo Nero, or Tuscan
- 1 large butternut squash (2 pounds, peeled)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 medium red onion, sliced thinly
- 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar
- 4 cups [[Torn Croutons]]
- Double batch of the [[Brown Butter Vinaigrette]]
- 2 cups of neutral tasting oil
- 16 sage leaves
- 3/4 cup of hazelnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped

## Directions

- Roast the butternut squash at 425 degrees for about 30-45 minutes
- [[Macerate]] the onion with the vinegar - at least 20 minutes
- Croutons and kale can sit in a salad bowl, and get tossed with 1/3 cup of the vinaigrette
- Fry the sage in batches - if the sage touches the oil and bubbles, the oil is hot enough. Put the sage in a paper towel on the side. 
- Add remaining croutons, hazelnut, squash, onion (not vinegar) to the salad bowl. Crumble in the friend sage. Dress with the remaining vinaigrette.
- Adjust seasoning with salt, sage frying oil, and vinaigrette. 
## Notes

- Add the Kale to the bottom of the salad mixing bowl, because otherwise it's quite hard to remove the croutons and onions from the bottom
- Kale absorbs a lot of oil
- I ended up salting the Kale alone.
