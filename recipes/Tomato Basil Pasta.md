## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp Olive Oil
- 2 tsp chili flakes
- 1 entire garlic
- 75% of the tomatoes from a Costco sized box
	- 90% of this should be blended
	- 10% should be sliced
- 1 small broccoli floret, cut to small pieces
- 5 sprigs of basil, and remove the leaves from the firm stem
- Salt to taste

## Directions

- In a wider pot, put the flame about half and add the olive oil
- Add the red chili flakes and wait for a slightly smoky smell
- Then, add the garlic. Smell should change from raw to slightly nutty / aromatic.
- Add the sliced tomato pieces.
- Once the tomatoes starting to release some of its juice, then add the rest of the blended tomatoes
- Let this set for about 7–10 minutes, on 3 or 3.5. The white of the tomato should disappear, and it will become a deep red.
- Salt here as well
- Use a masher to mash any remaining tomatoes
- Now, add the broccoli
- Add the leftover pasta water
- Then, add the basil. Let it sit for about 2–4 minutes, and then turn the heat off and put the lid on!
## Notes

```ad-tip
A salting strategy is to add salt after the sliced tomatoes, blended tomato, and broccoli.
```

```ad-tip
[[Ruhi]] likes it if you mash all the tomatoes, I like a few skin pieces dangling.
```

```ad-hint
If you cooked your pasta al-dente, then add it to the sauce along with a bit of water and let it boil for a minute
