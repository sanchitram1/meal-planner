## Ingredients

- 1 – 1.5 cups of Coconut milk
- 2–4 peanuts
- 2–4 cashews
- 1 whole frozen banana
- 1/2 cup of frozen fruits – assorted is fine
- Bottle directed amount of whey protein

## Directions

- The order you add it to the blender is what matters here. Make sure that you get a nice, smooth blend
	1. Coconut milk
	2. Banana
	3. Frozen fruits
	4. Vanilla Whey
	5. Nuts
	6. Top off with a bit of coconut milk

## Notes

```ad-tip
You can add creatin to this. Note that it makes it drier, so you'd needs to increase the coconut milk.
