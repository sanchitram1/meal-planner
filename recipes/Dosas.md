## Ingredients

- Store bought Dosa Batter, or [[Dosa Batter]]
- Sesame Oil

## Directions

- Use non-stickâ€¦I know.
- Pan should be hot
- Pour a ladle-full into a pan and rotate around the pan. Don't press too much otherwise it sticks.
- Add sesame oil to the edges, and then towards the center so it crisps up
- Once you see bubbles and it starts to crisp up, lift and flip!

## Notes

```ad-note
For crispy dosas, dilute the batter slightly
