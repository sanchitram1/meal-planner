## Ingredients

- 1 Plantain: cubed, small to medium-sized is fine.
- 1 tsp Mustard
- 1/2 tsp Urad Dal
- Pinch of Hing
- Pinch of Haldi
- Pinch of Sambhar Powder
- Salt to taste

## Directions

- Cut plantains into cubes. [[Keep cubed plantains in water to prevent oxidization]].
- Keep flame on medium
- [[Mustard seeds should pop about 75%, before adding the next spice]]
- Urad Dal
- Add the cubed plantains
- They should char just slightly. I like keeping the lid on so it cooks quicker.
